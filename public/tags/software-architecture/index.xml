In the high-stakes world of high-frequency trading (HFT), where milliseconds can mean millions, the quest for the ultimate trading platform is relentless. With its relentless demand for speed, low latency and reliability, served as the perfect proving ground for my exploration into Rust’s capabilities and the architectural paradigms that would best harness them.</description></item></channel></rss>
