If youâ€™ve been following along, you know weâ€™ve been deep-diving into Rust, exploring its nooks and crannies. This time around, Iâ€™m switching gears to something more hands-on. I want to walk you through a curated list of projects that have not only sharpened my skills but promise to elevate yours from beginner to pro.
1. Building a Guessing Game with aÂ Twist Alright, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into something that&amp;rsquo;s simple at first glance but has layers to peel backâ€”a guessing game, but not just any guessing game.</description></item><item><title>Traits: Advanced Trait Concepts and Dynamic Dispatch in Rust (PartÂ 2)</title><link>https://atharvapandey.com/post/traits-part2-advance-trait-concepts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://atharvapandey.com/post/traits-part2-advance-trait-concepts/</guid><description>Trait Objects and DynamicÂ Dispatch In Rust, polymorphism achieved through traits can take two forms: static and dynamic dispatch. Static dispatch is like knowing exactly what tool youâ€™re going to use for a job, making it fast and efficient. Dynamic dispatch, on the other hand, is more flexible, allowing you to choose the right tool while the job is already underway.
Understanding Trait Objects and dynÂ Keyword Trait objects with the dyn keyword allow for this kind of runtime flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Traits: Understanding Rust Traitsâ€Š - The Foundation (PartÂ 1)</title><link>https://atharvapandey.com/post/traits-understanding-rust-traitsthe-foundation-part1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://atharvapandey.com/post/traits-understanding-rust-traitsthe-foundation-part1/</guid><description>Welcome, fellow Rustaceans and curious minds! Today, we embark on the first installment of our series designed to explore Rustâ€™s powerful trait system. Traits are at the heart of Rustâ€™s type system, offering a flexible way to define shared behavior. In this post, weâ€™ll lay the foundation, exploring what traits are, how theyâ€™re used, and why theyâ€™re so integral to Rust programming. Grab a cup of your favorite brew, and letâ€™s dive in!</description></item><item><title>Mastering Rust Lifetimes: The Comprehensive Guide</title><link>https://atharvapandey.com/post/mastering-rust-lifetimes-the-comprehensive-guide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://atharvapandey.com/post/mastering-rust-lifetimes-the-comprehensive-guide/</guid><description>Mastering Rust Lifetimes: The Comprehensive Guide
Understanding lifetimes in Rust is crucial for any Rustacean aiming to write safe and efficient code. Lifetimes are Rust&amp;rsquo;s unique approach to managing memory without a garbage collector, ensuring memory safety and eliminating data races. This guide will take you from the basics to more nuanced aspects of lifetimes, with plenty of examples to solidify your understanding.

In the high-stakes world of high-frequency trading (HFT), where milliseconds can mean millions, the quest for the ultimate trading platform is relentless. With its relentless demand for speed, low latency and reliability, served as the perfect proving ground for my exploration into Rustâ€™s capabilities and the architectural paradigms that would best harness them.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://atharvapandey.com/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://atharvapandey.com/readme/</guid><description>Atharva Pandey: Blockchain &amp;amp; Backend Developer ðŸ‘‹ I&amp;rsquo;m Atharva Pandey, a dynamic technology leader specializing in blockchain and backend development.
